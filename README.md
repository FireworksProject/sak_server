SAK System Administration and Development
=========================================

This repository contains scripts and admin tools used to deploy and run the
[Fireworks Project](http://www.fireworksproject.com) development and support
server.  We call it our SAK server (Swiss Army Knife), and it is a "Jack of all
trades". It is usually deployed on Rackpace Cloud Servers.

See the `docs/` folder for more information.
